# My Own Spotify Hitster (or MOSH)
![Interface](example_interface.png)

Play Hitster with your own Spotify account based on your liked songs. (Future feature: based on a playlist).

Play alone or with friends.

This is still a work in progress. More features will (probably) be added.
The UI is also (clearly) a work in progress.

# Run the app
1. Install dependencies:
```shell
rye sync
```

2. Start app:
```shell
python src\my_own_spotify_hitster\main.py
```
